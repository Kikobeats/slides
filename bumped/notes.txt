it's me!

4]

important understand MY context to understand the purpose of the project.

JS is a very little language. The power of the language is in the depedency manager.
Inject dependencies is the base of JS core.

8]

Have a plan.

9]

Automatize all the things.

10]

Write software to help you write software.

First make easy generate the scaffold of the project. (yo-git)

Once that I have the control of my project, I created something easy to integrate with whatever
project

11] 

I created bumped for this purpose. Bumped is a CLI tool to automatize the maintain taks of a project.

12]

Basically is designed for make easy integrate with whatever project (npm) from now.

basic bumped actions:

- intialize a config file
- autodetect or add files into the config.
- set properties over the config files.
- increment the version and sync over the config files.

second level: PLUGINS

Plugins are the really power of the project. With plugins you connect other third software as hooks

You have pre and post hooks. They looks and conditions to check before and after publish a new version
of your software.

Also, bumped add quality in your software. Many actions related with a profesional software are automatically appens in your projects if you use bumped, for example:

- Generate a Changelog.
- Check that all depencies are ok.
- Lint config files and sort them.
- Deploy automation is cooooool.

Instead of write bash scripts for do stuff, convert the bash script into a plugin and have the advantages to integrate into bumped system. More shareable and crossover.
